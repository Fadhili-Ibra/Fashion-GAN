**Building a GAN for the Fashion Industry Using the Fashion-MNIST Dataset**

1. *Introduction*

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful deep learning models used for generating new data samples that resemble a given dataset. In this guide, we will build a GAN to generate fashion images using the Fashion-MNIST dataset. This dataset contains grayscale images of fashion items such as shoes, shirts, and dresses.
